# VendingCo2 - Vending Machine System 🏪
Welcome to the VendingCo2 project! This repository contains the implementation of a vending machine system developed in Java as part of an academic project for POO (Object Oriented Programming subject)

## Project Overview 📝
The VendingCo2 system simulates the functionalities of a real-world vending machine.
It allows users to purchase products using various payment methods, manage inventory, and track sales.
The system is designed using object-oriented principles and is structured to be modular and extendable.

**Note:** This project does not include a main method for execution.
It is purely an implementation meant to demonstrate the underlying structure and functionality of the vending machine system.
To test the system, external code or unit tests must be written to interact with the classes provided.

## Key Features ✨
- Product Management: Add, remove, and update products in the vending machine.
- Payment System: Supports payments via coins and card (wallet card system).
- Inventory Control: Keeps track of available stock and updates after each purchase.
- Error Handling: Ensures the vending machine operates smoothly with appropriate error messages for invalid operations.
